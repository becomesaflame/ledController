Run on startup:
- Add to /etc/rc.local:
/home/pi/powerPi/powerPi.local
  - Doesn't work
  - in log: error importing paho
    - /var/log/syslog
  - paho not installed in root's python3 environment
- Try to set up a pipenv in powerPi folder
$ pipenv install --three
  - get a stack trace and a timeout exception
  - this is the issue:
https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/401
- Give up on the right way for now and just sudo pip install paho-mqtt
  - didn't work
  - sudo python; import paho.mqtt.client also fails
- run script from rc.local as pi instead of root
su - pi -c /home/pi/powerPi/powerPi.local
  - it works!

PowerPi stops responding to MQTT after a few days
- Interim solution: set up cron job (/etc/crontab) to reboot nightly
- Added trap for Ctrl-Z 
  - dumps faulthandler traceback - shows stack trace for all threads
  - Output below:
